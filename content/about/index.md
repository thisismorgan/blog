Hey there 👋 and welcome to my personal website.

My name is Morgan and I am a software engineer currently working from the Bay Area. I program a lot in my free-time (when I'm not 🧶 or 🏃‍♀️) and post here from time to time when I discover something new and couldn't find a lot of related resources on the Internet.

The source code for this website can be found on github [here]().

Want to get in contact? Shoot me an email at [mkgriggs@gmail.com](mailto:mkgriggs@gmail.com).
